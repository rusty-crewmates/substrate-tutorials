# Exercises to learn substrate

## How to train ?

- fork this repository
- clone it on your machine
- code until all tests passes

> By default running `cargo test` will run test for every exercises in the workspace. Which is not optimal while working on a specific exercise.  
> Instead use our `test_in_docker.sh` scipt. It will run the tests for the exercise you pass as argument only.

If you want to run your pallet in a real runtime, you can easely edit the `substrate-node-template` and add your pallet to it's runtime.

## What is in those exercises ?

We designed the exercises to teach you:
- how to use the numerous features of Substrate
- some good Substrate practices
- some blockchain core principles

If you are stuck, you can always check the solution branch. It's not cheating, it's just learning 🧑‍🎓
