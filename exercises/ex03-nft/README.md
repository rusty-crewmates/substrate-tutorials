# Non fungible tokens

In this tutorial you will build simple NFT pallet.

## What to do ?

Edit the code in `pallets/nfts/src/lib.rs` until all tests passes. This time there is no more already filled extrinsic and neither detailed instructions. You will have to figure what to code yourself!

## What to focus on ?

First, you are building an NFT pallet. That's nice ! There is tons of activity, project and money about NFT, and you are learning how to code those.

About the actual coding, it's just a second round to make sure you really mastered the core of Substrate pallets. Once this is done, we will start to explore some more hairy features of the framework. Good luck !
