# Easy pallet: Fungible Token

In this exercise, you will build a simple fungible asset pallet.

## What to do?

Edit the code in `ex01-fungible-token/assets/src/lib.rs` until all tests pass.
We placed some helpful comments in the code ðŸ˜‰.

Launch the tests by running:

```sh
$ cargo test
```

## What to focus on?

While writing those extrinsics you will use the core features of a Substrate pallet: storages, events, and errors.
Try to remember how each one of those elements is declared and configured, and then how it is used in the extrinsics.

The pallet you are writing allows users to create their own coins, like Ethereum's ERC20. That's cool. If you had to implement it entirely by yourself, what would you change?
