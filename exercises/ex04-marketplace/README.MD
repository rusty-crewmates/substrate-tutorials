# Marketplace

On this exercise you are going to learn how to call functions between pallets.
And to do so we are going to build a marketplace pallet, that will allow users to buy and sell NFTs.

## Loosely vs thightly coupled pallets

As you maybe already understood, pallets are generic over a certain runtime. They are supposed to be generic enough to be used by other blockchains, with entierly different runtimes. It's only during the compilation that the runtime will inject it's specific types into the pallets to make them work all together.

It happen in `runtime/src/lib.rs`. Here is an example:

```rust
parameter_types! {
	pub const MinimumPeriod: u64 = SLOT_DURATION / 2;
}
impl pallet_timestamp::Config for Runtime {
	type MinimumPeriod = MinimumPeriod;
	/// A timestamp: milliseconds since the unix epoch.
	type Moment = u64;
	type OnTimestampSet = Aura;
	type WeightInfo = ();
}
```

`MinimumPeriod`, `Moment`, `OnTimestampSet` and `WeightInfo` are types defined in the `pallet_timestamp` config:

```rust
	/// The pallet configuration trait
	#[pallet::config]
	pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
		/// Type used for expressing timestamp.
		type Moment: Parameter
			+ Default
			+ AtLeast32Bit
			+ Scale<Self::BlockNumber, Output = Self::Moment>
			+ Copy
			+ MaxEncodedLen
			+ scale_info::StaticTypeInfo;
		/// Something which can be notified when the timestamp is set. Set this to `()` if not
		/// needed.
		type OnTimestampSet: OnTimestampSet<Self::Moment>;
		/// The minimum period between blocks. Beware that this is different to the *expected*
		/// period that the block production apparatus provides. Your chosen consensus system will
		/// generally work with this to determine a sensible block time. e.g. For Aura, it will be
		/// double this period on default settings.
		#[pallet::constant]
		type MinimumPeriod: Get<Self::Moment>;
		/// Weight information for extrinsics in this pallet.
		type WeightInfo: WeightInfo;
	}
```

In this runtime, moment is set as a `u64` but it could have been any type that check all the requirements descibed in the config.
And `OnTimestampSet` is set to `Aura` which is another pallet. The only requirement is that the type must implement the trait `OnTimestampSet<Self::Moment>`, and remember, through the magic of macro, pallets are types and can implement traits.

So this is the first way of making pallet iteract with each other, buy implementing a trait on one and injecting it in the config of the other at runtime. This way the second one will be able to call every functions defined by the trait.

The second way to access other pallets is also through config. Check this line:
```rust
	pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
        ...
    }
```

Here we specify that this pallet require `frame_system::Config`. Doing so every functions defined by the pallet `frame_system` will be available for this pallet.

We can talk about loosely coupled and tightly coupled pallets.
The first is more flexible, allow reusability and limit the access to the pallet though a trait acting an interface to only expose some handpicked functions. It's also very convenient for mocking and testing.
The second give full access and make the second pallet unusable without the first one.
As a rule of thumb try to only tightly couple your pallets to Substrate core pallets, and only when the other solution doesn't really make sense. Try to prefer as much as possible loosely coupled pallets.

# What to do ?

We implemented the same functionality, a marketplace for our nfts, the two ways:
- `pallet_loose_marketplace` must use the trait `Sellable` defined in `support/src/lib.rs` to interact with the `pallet_nft`
- `pallet_tight_marketplace` should add `pallet_nft` to it config to directly make calls to it's storage

You have to do this, and write the calls to the `pallet_nft` for each marketplace.
There is a few todo!() in the code preventing compilation. Start there and make the tests pass.
